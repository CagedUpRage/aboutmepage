  <h1 class="middlealign">Introducing Me</h1> 
    <h2 class="middlealign">Hobbies</h2>
     <p class="middlealign">The different hobbies that I had before the mission are the following: Reading, playing lacrosse, basketball, volleyball, hiking, singing, acting, gaming.</p>
     <p class="middlealign"> Of all of my hobbies I would have to say that lacrosse was my absolute favorite, I would always be at the school practicing. I had been playing since sixth grade and I was one of the few that started the official Provo High school lacrosse team. I was a defender and at one point I was ranked 7th in our region.</p>
     <p class="middlealign"> Other than that, the other hobby in which I excelled was gaming. In particular there is a game called Overwatch. I achieved masters rank and entered the top 3% of North America.</p>
  
  <h2 class="middlealign">Mission</h2>
      <p class="middlealign"> My mission was truly one of the best things that ever happened to me. I was called to the Argentina Santa Fe Mission, and had the amazing privilege of serving there the whole two years in a variety of assignments. Throughout my mission I got to be a District Leader, District Leader Trainer, Zone Leader, and the secretary to the Mission President for 7 months. I was able to learn about so many things, from so many people. The relationships that I was able to make are really life changing. I would recommend for every person everywhere to try and serve a mission in all of its various shapes and forms.</p>

   <h2 class="middlealign">Family</h2>
     <p class="middlealign"> I come from a family of 6, there's me, my two parents, and my three little sisters.</p>
     <p class="middlealign"> I love my family, but they are a bit crazy!
